# CSA-Portfolio

Compendium of various mini-labs for AP CSA.

Andrew Pu: (5/5)

This week I worked on a rock, paper, scissors game as
my mini project. I know that rock, paper, scissors is a pretty
basic game to code, but I wanted to start off with something easy
in order to get the hang of JFrames and GUI designing. I set up
the GUI for the game and added action listeners for the buttons.
I set the action listeners to take the user's choice and a
randomly generated choice to determine whether the user won
or not. To do this, I included switch statements to convert
the user's selection to an actual choice and set the images
(the user and the CPU each have a hand image that shows their
choice). Based on whether the result is win, lose, or tie, I
also change the text on the labels and also added a score
counter. I also figured out that I could add images to labels in
JFrame. I tried to add animation, but the delay didn't seem to
work; it just made my program lag a lot, so I decided to remove
it. Overall, I think made a decent amount of code, but I could've
added more features and maybe started another project this week.
I would give myself a 5/5.

All the code is in \CSA-Portfolio\src\Games\RPS

Next week I am planning on setting up a game menu which switches
to a certain game's panel when the button is clicked. I was going
to just make another project that creates a new JFrame when the
game is chosen, but during the forum I heard about card layouts,
which I thought might be more effective for my project.

Alex Titov: (5/5)

This week I was able to complete both of the labs I set out to complete. The graphing calculator was an interesting concept and I decided to go at it without looking up someone else’s calculator and simply copying that. I decided to create an array in order to store the x and y coordinates for N amount of data points. I devised a formula that would calculate the y coordinates based on the given x input. The user also has an amount of variables they can alter, essentially making possible to graph most of the exponential functions. I could not figure out how to add labels in time and neigher how to center the graph, so it will look quite odd. 
The gmail lab was pretty simple. Most of the time was spent learning and finding the jar files. The tricky thing was, one of those files was no longer available to the proper website so I had to sneak around github and sort of pirate it off of someone else’s project. Apart from that, the lab was quite easy. I ended up looking up quite a bit of tutorials just because this code is very nuanced and there is a procedure of things you have to add to the code that I’ve never used before. This lab was probably my favorite java thing I’ve done so far just because it is actually useful. Unlike printing ascii art or making a simple calculator, this lab can actually send emails. Most likely no one will ever use it because you have to disable all of your security features on your gmail account in order to run it, but that’s besides the point.

This week we started our individual projects while finishing up the calculator. For me, I worked on my store project. Even though we started last week, I wasn't used to Intellij so I watched some videos online to figure out how to program my GUI. While I finished my GUI, I did not have any code behind my buttons, which I think I should have done. I would give myself a 4/5.
