# CSA-Portfolio

Compendium of various mini-labs for AP CSA.

All of the labs are located in \CSA-Portfolio\src\. You can find the labs and run them here.

This week I worked on a rock, paper, scissors game as
my mini project. I know that rock, paper, scissors is a pretty
basic game to code, but I wanted to start off with something easy
in order to get the hang of JFrames and GUI designing. I set up
the GUI for the game and added action listeners for the buttons.
I set the action listeners to take the user's choice and a
randomly generated choice to determine whether the user won
or not. To do this, I included switch statements to convert
the user's selection to an actual choice and set the images
(the user and the CPU each have a hand image that shows their
choice). Based on whether the result is win, lose, or tie, I
also change the text on the labels and also added a score
counter. I also figured out that I could add images to labels in
JFrame. I tried to add animation, but the delay didn't seem to
work; it just made my program lag a lot, so I decided to remove
it. Overall, I think made a decent amount of code, but I could've
added more features and maybe started another project this week.
I would give myself a 5/5.

All the code is in \CSA-Portfolio\src\Games\RPS

Next week I am planning on setting up a game menu which switches
to a certain game's panel when the button is clicked. I was going
to just make another project that creates a new JFrame when the
game is chosen, but during the forum I heard about card layouts,
which I thought might be more effective for my project.

Alex Titov: (5/5)

This week I was able to complete both of the labs I set out to complete. The graphing calculator was an interesting concept and I decided to go at it without looking up someone else’s calculator and simply copying that. I decided to create an array in order to store the x and y coordinates for N amount of data points. I devised a formula that would calculate the y coordinates based on the given x input. The user also has an amount of variables they can alter, essentially making possible to graph most of the exponential functions. I could not figure out how to add labels in time and neigher how to center the graph, so it will look quite odd. 
The gmail lab was pretty simple. Most of the time was spent learning and finding the jar files. The tricky thing was, one of those files was no longer available to the proper website so I had to sneak around github and sort of pirate it off of someone else’s project. Apart from that, the lab was quite easy. I ended up looking up quite a bit of tutorials just because this code is very nuanced and there is a procedure of things you have to add to the code that I’ve never used before. This lab was probably my favorite java thing I’ve done so far just because it is actually useful. Unlike printing ascii art or making a simple calculator, this lab can actually send emails. Most likely no one will ever use it because you have to disable all of your security features on your gmail account in order to run it, but that’s besides the point.

This week we started our individual projects while finishing up the calculator. For me, I worked on my store project. Even though we started last week, I wasn't used to Intellij so I watched some videos online to figure out how to program my GUI. While I finished my GUI, I did not have any code behind my buttons, which I think I should have done. I would give myself a 4/5.

This week I began to develop my individual mini project. My project intent over these next few weeks is to develop and login, deposit, and withdraw functions which a user can use after logging in to save their money. This week I began to develop the login function. This started with me building the necessary components to do so. This included the JFrame, JPanel, userfield, userlabel, passwordfield, passlabel, update label, and the login label. This is seen in the journal. After doing that part, I had to position the pieces and set the dimensions for them. This built up the main part of the GUI and the location of where the parts were. Finally, I added the logic behind the login button to make sure that the currently only username and password is accurate and did this by using an if else statement. I was having issues connecting the logic to the button, so I will have to work on this next week. This was also from where I got my AHA moment as I realized that getText() was not working for the password field. As a result, I had to do research, and I found out that you have to use the valueOf option as the password field is encrypted. My goals for the next is to finish up the login UI and add a new user function to it and begin on the main UI where you deposit and withdraw. All in all, I would give myself a 4/5 this week as I was able to accomplish a lot but I could have done more.
