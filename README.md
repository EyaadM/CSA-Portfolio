# CSA-Portfolio

Compendium of various mini-labs for AP CSA.

Andrew Pu: This week I worked on a rock, paper, scissors game as
my mini project. I know that rock, paper, scissors is a pretty
basic game to code, but I wanted to start off with something easy
in order to get the hang of JFrames and GUI designing. I set up
the GUI for the game and added action listeners for the buttons.
I set the action listeners to take the user's choice and a
randomly generated choice to determine whether the user won
or not. To do this, I included switch statements to convert
the user's selection to an actual choice and set the images
(the user and the CPU each have a hand image that shows their
choice). Based on whether the result is win, lose, or tie, I
also change the text on the labels and also added a score
counter. I also figured out that I could add images to labels in
JFrame. I tried to add animation, but the delay didn't seem to
work; it just made my program lag a lot, so I decided to remove
it. Overall, I think made a decent amount of code, but I could've
added more features and maybe started another project this week.
Since I didn't do as much as I wanted, I would give myself a 9/10

All the code is in \CSA-Portfolio\src\Games\RPS

Next week I am planning on setting up a game menu which switches
to a certain game's panel when the button is clicked. I was going
to just make another project that creates a new JFrame when the
game is chosen, but during the forum I heard about card layouts,
which I thought might be more effective for my project.
